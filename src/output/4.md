# Maximal matching in bipartite graph

We have following Graph $G$:

```mermaid
graph TD;
	0(" ");
	1(" ");
	2(" ");
	3(" ");
	4(" ");
	5(" ");
	6(" ");
	7(" ");
	8(" ");
	9(" ");
	10(" ");
	11(" ");
	0 --- 1;
	0 --- 7;
	2 --- 1;
	2 --- 3;
	4 --- 3;
	4 --- 9;
	4 --- 11;
	6 --- 5;
	6 --- 7;
	6 --- 9;
	8 --- 5;
	10 --- 11;
```

We may see two parts on the graph. We can visualize it by giving them indexes.

```mermaid
graph TD;
	0("1.0");
	1("2.0");
	2("1.0");
	3("2.0");
	4("1.0");
	5("2.0");
	6("1.0");
	7("2.0");
	8("1.0");
	9("2.0");
	10("1.0");
	11("2.0");
	0 --- 1;
	0 --- 7;
	2 --- 1;
	2 --- 3;
	4 --- 3;
	4 --- 9;
	4 --- 11;
	6 --- 5;
	6 --- 7;
	6 --- 9;
	8 --- 5;
	10 --- 11;
```

Now we will find all independent sets of a transversal matroid. Because there may be a way more graphs, we will put it in a separate files.First part we have [here](./../output/4(1).md) and second [here](./../output/4(2).md). And showcase just the maximal sets from both.

### $I_{1}$

```mermaid
graph TD;
	0("0.0");
	1(" ");
	2("0.0");
	3(" ");
	4("0.0");
	5(" ");
	6("0.0");
	7(" ");
	8("0.0");
	9(" ");
	10("0.0");
	11(" ");
	0 -.- 1;
	0 --- 7;
	2 -.- 1;
	2 --- 3;
	4 -.- 3;
	4 -.- 9;
	4 --- 11;
	6 -.- 5;
	6 -.- 7;
	6 --- 9;
	8 --- 5;
	10 --- 11;
```

### $I_{2}$

```mermaid
graph TD;
	0(" ");
	1("0.0");
	2(" ");
	3("0.0");
	4(" ");
	5("0.0");
	6(" ");
	7("0.0");
	8(" ");
	9("0.0");
	10(" ");
	11("0.0");
	0 -.- 1;
	0 -.- 7;
	2 --- 1;
	2 -.- 3;
	4 --- 3;
	4 -.- 9;
	4 -.- 11;
	6 -.- 5;
	6 --- 7;
	6 --- 9;
	8 --- 5;
	10 --- 11;
```

## Intersection

Last think to show we will find the maximal independent sets from both which are the same.

```mermaid
graph TD;
	0(" ");
	1(" ");
	2(" ");
	3(" ");
	4(" ");
	5(" ");
	6(" ");
	7(" ");
	8(" ");
	9(" ");
	10(" ");
	11(" ");
	0 --- 1;
	0 -.- 7;
	2 -.- 1;
	2 --- 3;
	4 -.- 3;
	4 --- 9;
	4 -.- 11;
	6 -.- 5;
	6 --- 7;
	6 -.- 9;
	8 --- 5;
	10 --- 11;
```
