# Maximal matching in bipartite graph

We have following Graph $G$:

```mermaid
graph TD;
	0(" ");
	1(" ");
	2(" ");
	3(" ");
	4(" ");
	5(" ");
	6(" ");
	7(" ");
	8(" ");
	0 --- 1;
	0 --- 2;
	0 --- 3;
	0 --- 4;
	0 --- 5;
	0 --- 6;
	0 --- 7;
	0 --- 8;
```

We may see two parts on the graph. We can visualize it by giving them indexes.

```mermaid
graph TD;
	0("1.0");
	1("2.0");
	2("2.0");
	3("2.0");
	4("2.0");
	5("2.0");
	6("2.0");
	7("2.0");
	8("2.0");
	0 --- 1;
	0 --- 2;
	0 --- 3;
	0 --- 4;
	0 --- 5;
	0 --- 6;
	0 --- 7;
	0 --- 8;
```

Now we will find all independent sets of a transversal matroid. Because there may be a way more graphs, we will put it in a separate files.First part we have [here](./../output/5(1).md) and second [here](./../output/5(2).md). And showcase just the maximal sets from both.

### $I_{1}$

```mermaid
graph TD;
	0("0.0");
	1(" ");
	2(" ");
	3(" ");
	4(" ");
	5(" ");
	6(" ");
	7(" ");
	8(" ");
	0 -.- 1;
	0 -.- 2;
	0 -.- 3;
	0 -.- 4;
	0 -.- 5;
	0 -.- 6;
	0 -.- 7;
	0 --- 8;
```

### $I_{2}$

```mermaid
graph TD;
	0(" ");
	1("0.0");
	2("0.0");
	3("0.0");
	4("0.0");
	5("0.0");
	6("0.0");
	7("0.0");
	8("0.0");
	0 --- 1;
	0 --- 2;
	0 --- 3;
	0 --- 4;
	0 --- 5;
	0 --- 6;
	0 --- 7;
	0 --- 8;
```

## Intersection

Last think to show we will find the maximal independent sets from both which are the same.

```mermaid
graph TD;
	0(" ");
	1(" ");
	2(" ");
	3(" ");
	4(" ");
	5(" ");
	6(" ");
	7(" ");
	8(" ");
	0 --- 1;
	0 -.- 2;
	0 -.- 3;
	0 -.- 4;
	0 -.- 5;
	0 -.- 6;
	0 -.- 7;
	0 -.- 8;
```
